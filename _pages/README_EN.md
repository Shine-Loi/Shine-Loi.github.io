# [Shine's Studying Materials Google Drive]

Studying materials related to software or physics will be uploaded to Google Dirve in "Shine's Studying Materials" folder.

I create all the study materials myself and upload pdf files that summarize key concepts. All materials will be shared free of charge. If the uploaded materials were helpful, please consider making a donation, even a small amount.
