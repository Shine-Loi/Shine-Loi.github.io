# 1. while Loop
The 'while' loop has a similar structure to the 'if' statement. However, 'while' loop iterates the code until the expression is false, while the 'if' statement is performed only once.

&nbsp;

```python
n=1
while n<11:
    print(n, end=" ")
    n+=1
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  |
