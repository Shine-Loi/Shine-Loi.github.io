# 1. if ~ else Statement
The if statement is similar in the almost of programming languages. In Python, you can use if statement with the structure below.

&nbsp;

```python
if expression:
    Run if expression is true.
```

&nbsp;

When the expression is true, the if statement is executed, distinguished by indentation. If the expression is false, Python will skip the if statement. The if statement can be used alone, but it can also be used together with an else statement. The else statement is executed in all cases where the expression is false.

&nbsp;

```python
n=int(input("Number: "))

if n%2==0:
    print("{} is an even number.".format(str(n)))
else:
    print("{} is an odd number.".format(str(n)))
```

&nbsp;

| 1 |

&nbsp;

| Input Example |
|---|
