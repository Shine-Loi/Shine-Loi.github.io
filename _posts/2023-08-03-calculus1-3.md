# 1) The Definition of a Continuity
## Theorem 1.5: The Definition of a Continuity
The function \\(f(x)\\) is continuouse at \\(x=a\\) if \\(\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a} f(x)=f(a)\\)

&nbsp;

# 2) The Intermediate Value Theorem
The intermediate value theorem is employed for approximating the range of roots of equations. In calculus, we will use it without proof.

&nbsp;

## Theorem 1.6: The Intermediate Value Theorem
If \\(f(x)\\) is a continuouse function on a closed interval \\([a,b]\\) and \\(f(a)\neq f(b)\\), then there exists a \\(c\\) in the open interval (a,b) such that \\(f(c)=Q\\) for any value \\(Q\\) between \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\).
