# 1) Summary of Differentiation Rules
We can prove them by using the definition of the derivative. The differentiation rules provided below are the outcomes of frequently used patterns. If you subsitute them into the process of calculating derivatives, as explained earlier, you can obtain the results below (albeit through a cumbersome process). In calculus, we often use them without proof.

## Theorem 2.5: Summary of Differentiation Rules
1. \\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} a=0\\)
2. \\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} x^n=n\cdot x^{n-1}\\), \\(n\\) is a real number
3. \\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} a\cdot f(x)=a\cdot \frac{d}{dx} f(x)\\), \\(a\\) is a constant
4. \\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} [f(x)+g(x)]=\frac{d}{dx} f(x)+\frac{d}{dx} g(x)\\)
5. \\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} [f(x)\cdot g(x)]=f(x)\cdot \frac{d}{dx} g(x)+g(x)\cdot \frac{d}{dx} f(x)\\)
6. \\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} \left[ \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right]=\frac{+g(x)\cdot \frac{d}{dx} f(x)-f(x)\cdot \frac{d}{dx} g(x)}{\{ g(x)\} ^2}\\)

# 2) Differentiation of Trigonometric Functions
You can also prove the differentiation of trigonometric functions by using the definition of the derivative, as described above. However, you may also use some specific formulas designed for trigonometric functions. In calculus, we often use them without proof.
