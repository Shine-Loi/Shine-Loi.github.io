# 1) Summary of Differentiation Rules
We can prove them by using the definition of derivative. The differentiation rules below are just results of frequently used patterns. If you subsitute them in the process of calculating derivatives that explained before, you can get results below (with a cumbersome process). In calculus, we will use them without proof.

## Theorem 2.5: Summary of Differentiation Rules
1. \\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} a=0\\)
2. \\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} x^n=n\cdot x^{n-1}\\), \\(n\\) is a real number
3. \\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} a\cdot f(x)=a\cdot \frac{d}{dx} f(x)\\), \\(a\\) is a constant
4. \\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} [f(x)+g(x)]=\frac{d}{dx} f(x)+\frac{d}{dx} g(x)\\)
5. \\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} [f(x)\cdot g(x)]=f(x)\cdot \frac{d}{dx} g(x)+g(x)\cdot \frac{d}{dx} f(x)\\)
6. \\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} \left[ \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right]=\frac{+g(x)\cdot \frac{d}{dx} f(x)-f(x)\cdot \frac{d}{dx} g(x)}{\{ g(x)\} ^2}
