# 1. return Statement
The 'return' statement is used to produce a result from functions. I explained only basic functions that do not use the 'return' statement in the "7-1. Defining and Calling Functions" post. This is because the task of the function is only to perform a print() function. If there is a function that takes arguments and calculates the result value, it requires 'return' statement. This is an example function that returns the greater value of two arguments.

&nbsp;

```python
def maxval(a, b):
    if a>b:
        return a
    else:
        return b

print(maxval(2, 3), " is larger than the other.")
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| 3  is larger than the other. |

&nbsp;

The 'return' statement can return all types of data, such as a string, list, dictionary, and so on.

&nbsp;

```python
def makedict(key, value):
    newdict={"a":"A", "b":"B"}
    newdict[key]=value
    return newdict

print(makedict("c", "C"))
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| {'a': 'A', 'b': 'B', 'c': 'C'} |
