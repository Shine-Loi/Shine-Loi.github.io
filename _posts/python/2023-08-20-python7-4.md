# 1. Keyword Arguments
If there are parameters in the declared function, you usually need to provide arguments in the same order as the parameters. However, there is another method to pass arguments to parameters without considering their order.

&nbsp;

```python
def introduce(name, age, city):
    print("Name: ", name)
    print("Age: ", age)
    print("City: ", city)

introduce("Shine", 24, "Seoul")

print()

introduce(city="New-York", name="Rose", age=20)
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| Name:  Shine |
| Age:  24 |
| City:  Seoul |
â€‹|  |
| Name:  Rose |
| Age:  20 |
| City:  New-York |
