# 1. Relational Operators
Relational operators are often used in control statements. The list of relational operators is represented below. The result of relational operations will be a logical value like 'True' or 'False'.

&nbsp;

- ==: Equal to
- \>: Greater than
- <: Less than
- \>=: Greater than or Equal to
- <=: Less than or Equal to

&nbsp;

```python
a=10

print("a==10: ", a==10)
print("a>5: ", a>5)
print("a<5: ", a<5)
print("a>=10", a>=10)
print("a<=9: ", a<=9)
print("a!=1: ", a!=1)
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| a==10:  True |
| a>5:  True |
| a<5:  False |
| a>=10 True |
| a<=9:  False |
| a!=1:  True |
