# 1. The Local Variables and the Global Variables
The local variables are declared within functions and are only accessible within those functions. They are created when the function is called and discarded when the function finishes. If you attempt to access local variables outside the function, Python will raise an error.\
Global variables, on the other hand, can be used throughout the entire program. They persist throughout the execution of the program. To access global variables within functions, you need to use the 'global' keyword.

&nbsp;

```python
global_var=20 # It is a global variable

def exfunc():
    global global_var
    # The 'global' keyword is required to use a global variable
    
    local_var=10 # It is a local variable
    print("1.", local_var, global_var)
    
    global_var=30
    # You can change the value of a global variable

exfunc()

# print(local_var) <- The local variable is not accessible outside the function
print("2.", global_var)
```
