# 1. Characteristics of Objects
Python excels in supporting object-oriented programming (OOP), a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects. Objects can represent both a data (referred to as attributes) and methods (functions associated with the object). Attributes have a noun meaning, representing the data, while methods have a verb meaning, indicating the operations. In OOP, objects are instantiated from classes, which serve as blueprints defining the data and behaviors an object will have. To use an object, you first need to declare and define a class.

&nbsp;

The code below is an example to explain an object.\
1) The '\_\_init\_\_()' function is called a constructor. It is executed automatically when the objects are created. In Python, the name of constructors is always '\_\_init\_\_()'. The 'self' parameter in the code is a variable that points to the object itself and can be used only in the class. All functions in the class must declare the 'self' parameter.\
2) The parameters of '\_\_init\_\_()' are 'self' and 'name'. It sets an attribute of the object as 'name'. After that, it sets a 'name' attribute as the name that you set.\
3) The 'bark()' function is arbitrarily defined by me. When you call this function, it will print a sentence "{} is barking!".\
4) When the code creates an object 'mydog', it will set the name of the object as 'Jack' through the 'Dog' class. After then, you can access the attributes and methods with a dot(.).

&nbsp;

```python
class Dog:
    # This is a class
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        # Constructor method initializes the object with a name attribute
        self.name=name
    
    def bark(self):
        # Method to make the dog bark using its name attribute
        print("{} is barking!".format(self.name))
    
mydog=Dog("Jack")
# 'mydog' is an object of the Dog class

print(mydog.name)
# Accessing the 'name' attribute of the 'mydog' object

mydog.bark()
# Calling the 'bark' method on the 'mydog' object
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| Jack |
| Jack is barking! |
