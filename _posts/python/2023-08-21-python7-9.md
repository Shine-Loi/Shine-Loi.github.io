# 1. Functions that Do Nothing
If you write 'pass' inside a function, it will do nothing. You can use this feature to make a frame of a sophisticated code.

&nbsp;

```python
def donothing():
    if True:
        pass
    else:
        pass
    
donothing()
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| (It will print nothing.) |
