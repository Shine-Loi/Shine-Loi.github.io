# 1. Python Built-in Functions
Python built-in functions are the basic functions that do not require an 'import' statement. The print() and input() functions are representative examples. The list of Python built-in functions is below. I recommend not memorizing this list but using it every time you need. Then, you will naturally memorize it.
