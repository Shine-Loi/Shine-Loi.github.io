# 1. Integer Type
The integer type in Python represents integers(positive integers, negative integers, 0) used in mathematics and is denoted as 'int'. Python doesn't limit the size of integers, unlike some other programming languages. Integers in Python can be expanded until the limit of available memory.

&nbsp;

```python
a=0
b=5000
c=-3000

print(type(a), a)
print(type(b), b)
print(type(c), c)
print("a + b = ", a+b)
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| <class 'int'> 0 |
| <class 'int'> 5000 |
| <class 'int'> -3000 |
| a + b =  5000 |

# 2. Real Number Type
The real number type in Python represents the numbers that contain a decimal point and is denoted as 'float'. The real number type is represented by the floating-point method, and it is calculated accurately up to 15 decimal places.

&nbsp;

```python
a=5e3
b=120E5
c=3.14

print(type(a), a)
print(type(b), b)
print(type(c), c)
print("a + b = ", a+b)
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| <class 'float'> 5000.0 |
| <class 'float'> 12000000.0 |
| <class 'float'> 3.14 |
| a + b =  12005000.0 |

# 3. Complex Number Type
The complex number type represents numbers that contain imaginary numbers and is denoted as 'complex'. The complex number type is represented as 'a+bj', where 'a' is the real number part, and 'b' is the imaginary number part. Python supports complex number calculating functions.

&nbsp;

```python
a=1+5j
b=complex(5,-4)

print(type(a), a)
print(type(b), b)
print("a + b = ", a+b)
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| <class 'complex'> (1+5j) |
| <class 'complex'> (5-4j) |
| a + b =  (6+1j) |
