# 1. String Concatenation
String in Python represents a type that consists of several characters. Python considers only one character as a string whose length is 1, unlike some other programming languages. I already explained the way to print a string in the "1-2. Print Data" post, so I will skip it in this post.\
[1-2. Print Date](https://shine-loi.github.io/python/python1-2/)

&nbsp;

We can perform addition and multiplication operations on strings. String addition concatenates several strings, and multiplication repeats the same string several times.

&nbsp;

```python
print("Hello"+"World")
print("Hello"*5)
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| HelloWorld |
| HelloHelloHelloHelloHello |

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 2. String Slicing
You can easily slice a string using indices. The method for slicing a string is explained below. It is important to note that in Python, if you set the last number of a range as n, it will operate until n-1.

&nbsp;

- a[6]: 6th character (The first character is 0th.)
- a[6:]: From the 6th character to the last character
- a[:7]: From the first character to the 6th character (Until just before the 7th character)
- a[3:7]: From the 3rd character to the 6th character (Until just before the 7th character)
- a[-5]: 5th character from the end
- a[3:-5]: From the 3rd character to 6th character from the end (Until just before the 5th character from the end.)

&nbsp;

```python
a="Hello World!"

print("a[6]:", a[6])
print("a[6:]:", a[6:])
print("a[:7]:", a[:7])
print("a[3:7]:", a[3:7])
print("a[-5]:", a[-5])
print("a[3:-5]:", a[3:-5])
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| a[6]: W |
| a[6:]: World! |
| a[:7]: Hello W |
| a[3:7]: lo W |
| a[-5]: o |
| a[3:-5]: lo W |

&nbsp;

You can set the index not only as a character but also as a word using the index() function. Surround a word to set it as an index within the parentheses () of the index() function. When you set the word as an index, Python will store the location of the first character of the word as an index.

&nbsp;

```python
a="Hello World!"
i=a.index("World")

print("i:", i)
print("a[:i]:", a[:i])
print("a[i:]:", a[i:])
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| i: 6 |
| a[:i]: Hello  |
| a[i:]: World! |

&nbsp;

# 3. format() Function
You can easily assemble strings using format() function, as I explained in the "1-2. Print According to Format" section of the "1-2. Print Data" post. "{:-^20}".format("Center")" in the code below means create 20 spaces, put the string in the parentheses () of format() function at the center, and fill the other spaces with "-". You can put the string at the left or right with "<" or ">" instead of "^".

&nbsp;

```python
print("{:-^20}".format("Center"))
print("{:-<20}".format("Left"))
print("{:->20}".format("Right"))
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| -------Center------- |
| Left---------------- |
| ---------------Right |

# 4. String Methods
These are some functions related to strings. You can find more functions or details on Google or elsewhere.

&nbsp;

- len(): Calculate the length of the string. Python considers all characters as having a length of 1, such as English letters, spaces, special characters, and so on.
- strip(): Remove spaces before and after the string.
- lstrip(), rstrip(): Remove spaces beore or after the string.
- count(): Count the number of occurrences of the string in the parentheses () within the entire sentence.
- upper(): Change all characters to uppercase.
- lower(): Change all characters to lowercase.
- find(): Calculate the location of the string in the parentheses (). Python will print -1 when it cannot find the string in the entire sentence.
- index(): Same function as the find() function. However, it will cause an error when it cannot find the string in the entire sentence.
- replace("str1", "str2"): Change "str1" into "str2".
- split(): Split the string based on the characters in the parentheses () and store it in list format.
- join(): Combine all components of a list to a string.

&nbsp;

```python
a="   There are space here.   "
b="My name is Shine."

print("1.", len(a))
# Returns the lenght of a string

print("2.", a)
print("3.", a.strip())
print("4.", a.lstrip())
print("5.", a.rstrip())
# Removes whitespace

print("6.", a.count(" "))
# Counts a specific substring

print("7.", b.upper())
print("8.", b.lower())
# Converts a string to lowercase or uppercase

print("9.", b.find("Shine"))
print("10.", b.find("Shne"))
print("11.", b.index("Shine"))
# print(b.index("Shne")) <- It will cause an error
# Finds the first occurrence of a substring

print("12.", b.replace("Shine","Rose"))
# Replaces a specific substring with another substring

c=b.split(" ")
print("13.", c, type(c))
# Splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specific delimiter

d=","
print("14.", d.join(c))
d="/"
print("15.", d.join(c))
# Concatenate elements into a single string
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| 1. 27 |
| 2.    There are space here.    |
| 3. There are space here. |
| 4. There are space here.    |
| 5.    There are space here. |
| 6. 9 |
| 7. MY NAME IS SHINE. |
| 8. my name is shine. |
| 9. 11 |
| 10. -1 |
| 11. 11 |
| 12. My name is Rose. |
| 13. ['My', 'name', 'is', 'Shine.'] <class 'list'> |
| 14. My,name,is,Shine. |
| 15. My/name/is/Shine. |
