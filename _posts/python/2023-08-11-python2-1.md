# 1. Constants
Constants refer to data whose value does not change from the beginning of the program until the program ends. Due to these characteristics, it is not possible to declare constants directly. The math module defines several constants as follows.

&nbsp;

```python
import math

pi=math.pi
e=math.e

print("pi:␣", pi)
print("e:␣", e)
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| pi: 3.141592653589793 |
| e: 2.718281828459045 |

# 2. Variables
Variables refer to data that can change their values. In Python, types of variables are not set when declaring a new variable, unlike in other programming languages. In other words, when you declare a variable, you can store any type of data in it. The variables can change their values by storing other values.

&nbsp;

```python
age=22
name="Shine"
print("{}␣is␣{}␣years␣old.".format(name, age))

age=20
name="Rose"
print("{}␣is␣{}␣years␣old.".format(name, age))
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| Shine is 22 years old. |
| Rose is 20 years old. |

&nbsp;

## 2-1. Variable Declaration Rules
You can declare variable names following these rules:
- Variable names can be declared using a combination of English letters, upper and lower case letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
- Variable names cannot start with a number.
- English letters are case sensitive.

&nbsp;

The following words are called reserved keywords and are used as commands in Python, so they cannot be used as variable names.

&nbsp;

if, else, elif, for, and, while, with, or, not, nonlocal, lambda, is, in, return, raise, pass, yield, import, global, finally, class, continu, except, del, def, break, assert and so on.
