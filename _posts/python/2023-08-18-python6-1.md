# 1. if ~ else Statement
The 'if' statement is similar in the almost of programming languages. In Python, you can use 'if' statement with the structure below.

&nbsp;

```python
if expression:
    Run if expression is true.
```

&nbsp;

When the expression is true, the 'if' statement is executed, distinguished by indentation. If the expression is false, Python will skip the if statement. The 'if' statement can be used alone, but it can also be used together with an 'else' statement. The 'else' statement is executed in all cases where the expression is false.

&nbsp;

```python
n=int(input("Number: "))

if n%2==0:
    print("{} is an even number.".format(str(n)))
else:
    print("{} is an odd number.".format(str(n)))
```

&nbsp;

| Input Example |
|---|
| 1 |

| Output |
|---|
| Number: 1 |
| 1 is an odd number. |

&nbsp;

| Input Example |
|---|
| 2 |

| Output |
|---|
| Number: 2 |
| 2 is an even number. |

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 2. Multiple if Statement
You can use several statements by using 'elif'. If the expression in the 'if' statement is false, Python will skip it and check the next 'elif' statement. The multiple 'if' statement will be finished when an expression is true or when it checks all of the expressions.

&nbsp;

```python
name=input("Name: ")

if len(name)==0:
    print("You didn't write your name.")
elif len(name)==1:
    print("Your name is too short.")
else:
    print("Your name is {}, consisting of {} letters.".format(name, len(name)))
```

&nbsp;

| Input Example 1 |
|---|
|  |

| Output |
|---|
| Name:  |
| You didn't write your name. |

&nbsp;

| Input Example 2 |
|---|
| S |

| Output |
|---|
| Name: S |
| Your name is too short. |

&nbsp;

| Input Example 3 |
|---|
| Shine |

| Output |
|---|
| Name: Shine |
| Your name is Shine, consisting of 5 |

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 3. Nested if Statement
The nested 'if' statement is an 'if' statement inside another 'if' statement.

&nbsp;

```python
score=int(input("Score: "))
if score<0 or score>100:
    print("Error")
else:
    if score>=90:
        print("Good!")
    else:
        print("Soso")
```

&nbsp;

| Input Example 1 |
|---|
| -5 |

| Output |
|---|
| Score: -5 |
| Error |

&nbsp;

| Input Example 2 |
|---|
| 95 |

| Output |
|---|

| Good! |

&nbsp;
