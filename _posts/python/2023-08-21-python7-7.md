# 1. Callback Functions
A callback function is a function that is passed to other functions as an argument. In Python, you can easily reference functions by assigning them to the variable. In the code below, I referenced the function 'funcA' as 'newfunc'.

&nbsp;

```python
def funcA():
    print("This is a 'funcA' function.")

newfunc=funcA
# Now you can use newfunc as funcA

newfunc()
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| This is a 'funcA' function. |

&nbsp;

You can also pass a callback function as a parameter to other functions. In the code below, the functions 'add' and 'multiple' are referenced in the function 'operfunc' as callback functions. You can call and execute the referenced functions within the 'operfunc' function.

&nbsp;

```python
def operfunc(x, y, operation):
    print(operation(x, y))

# These are callback functions
def add(x, y):
    return x+y

def multiple(x, y):
    return x*y

print("operfunc(3, 4, add):", end=" ")
operfunc(3, 4, add)

print("operfunc(3, 4, multiple):", end=" ")
operfunc(3, 4, multiple)
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| operfunc(3, 4, add): 7 |
| operfunc(3, 4, multiple): 12 |
