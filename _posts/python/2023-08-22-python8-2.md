# 1. Inheritance
Inheritance is one of the most important characteristics of object-oriented programming. The class that inherits is called a parent class, and the class that is inherited is called a child class. The child class can use all the attributes and features of the parent class. The word 'Inheritance' doesn't mean taking data but taking features. You can declare the parent class the same way you create general classes. The example code is too long to explain at once, so I have seperated by the class.

&nbsp;

In the code below, the 'smartphone' class is a parent class that represents general features of smartphones. The 'smartphone' class contains functions product() and calling(), and the child classes can use these functions.

&nbsp;

```python
class smartphone():
    # Base class representing a generic smartphone
    
    def __init__(self, maker, name):
        # constructor to initialize the maker and name attributes
        self.maker=maker
        self.name=name
    
    def product(self):
        # Method to display the product information
        print("{} is {}'s product.".format(self.name, self.maker))
    
    def calling(self):
        # Method to simulate making a call with the smartphone
        print("{} smartphone is making a call.".format(self.name))

```

&nbsp;

The code below is a 'Samsung' class, the first child class. To declare a child class, you have to write the name of the parent class in the parentheses (). The 'Samsung' class defines only the buy() function, but it can use the product() and calling() functions from its parent class.

&nbsp;

```python
class Samsung(smartphone):
    # Subclass representing a Samsung smartphone, inheriting from smartphone
    
    def __init__(self, maker, name, price):
        # Constructor to initialize the attributes of Samsung smartphone
        super().__init__(maker, name)
        self.price=price
    
    def buy(self):
        # Method to display the price of the Samsung smartphon
        print("{} is {} won.".format(self.name, self.price))
```

&nbsp;

The code below is an 'Apple' class, the second child class. The 'Apple' class is also inherited by the 'smartphone' class and has the same structure as the 'Samsung' class. However, the buy() function of the 'Samsung' class represents the price as 'won', and the buy() function of the 'Apple' class represents the price as 'dollar'. Similar to this example, child classes are dependent classes, so they don't have to have the same structure. Even, they can define definitely different functions.

&nbsp;

```python
class Apple(smartphone):
    # Subclass representing an Apple smartphone, inheriting from Smartphone
    
    def __init__(self, maker, name, price):
        # Constructor to initialize the attributes of Apple smartphone
        super().__init__(maker, name)
        self.price=price
    
    def buy(self):
        # Method to display the price of the Apple smartphone
        print("{} is {} dollars.".format(self.name, self.price))
```

&nbsp;

The entire code is below.

&nbsp;

```python
class smartphone():
    # Base class representing a generic smartphone
    
    def __init__(self, maker, name):
        # constructor to initialize the maker and name attributes
        self.maker=maker
        self.name=name
    
    def product(self):
        # Method to display the product information
        print("{} is {}'s product.".format(self.name, self.maker))
    
    def calling(self):
        # Method to simulate making a call with the smartphone
        print("{} smartphone is making a call.".format(self.name))


class Samsung(smartphone):
    # Subclass representing a Samsung smartphone, inheriting from smartphone
    
    def __init__(self, maker, name, price):
        # Constructor to initialize the attributes of Samsung smartphone
        super().__init__(maker, name)
        self.price=price
    
    def buy(self):
        # Method to display the price of the Samsung smartphon
        print("{} is {} won.".format(self.name, self.price))


class Apple(smartphone):
    # Subclass representing an Apple smartphone, inheriting from Smartphone
    
    def __init__(self, maker, name, price):
        # Constructor to initialize the attributes of Apple smartphone
        super().__init__(maker, name)
        self.price=price
    
    def buy(self):
        # Method to display the price of the Apple smartphone
        print("{} is {} dollars.".format(self.name, self.price))


s24=Samsung("Samsung", "Galaxy S24", "1,300,000")
# Creating an instance of Samsung smartphone
s24.product()
s24.calling()
s24.buy()

i15=Apple("Apple", "iPhone 15", "1000")
# Creating an instance of Apple smartphone
i15.product()
i15.calling()
i15.buy()
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| Galaxy S24 is Samsung's product. |
| Galaxy S24 smartphone is making a call. |
| Galaxy S24 is 1,300,000 won. |
| iPhone 15 is Apple's product. |
| iPhone 15 smartphone is making a call. |
| iPhone 15 is 1000 dollars. |
