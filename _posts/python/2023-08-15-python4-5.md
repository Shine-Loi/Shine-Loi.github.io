# 1. Ternary Operators
Ternary operators are often used in lambda functions, that I will explain later. The structure of a ternary operation command is as follow:\
(Command performed when true) if (Condition) else (Command performed when false).

&nbsp;

```python
print("True") if True else print("False")
print("True") if False else print("False")
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| True |
| False |
