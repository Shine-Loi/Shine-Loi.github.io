# 1. Modules
Module is a library that is a collection of the frequently used codes. If you collect and store codes related to functions, variables, classes, and so on in one file, you can use them efficiently by referencing only the name of the module. Additionally, modules facilitate maintenance and help structure code in large projects.

&nbsp;

To create a module, collect functions, classes, variables, and so on in one file, and save it with the '.py' extension. Then, you can load the module with the methods below.
- import (filename): Load the entire module.
- from (filename) import (function or class): Load specific functions or classes from the module.
- import (filename) as (nickname): Load the module as a nickname.

&nbsp;

The code below is an example module that is saved as 'example_module.py'.

&nbsp;

```python
def hello(name):
    print("Hello", name)

class calculate:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a+b

PI=3.141592
```

&nbsp;

This file can be loaded using the code below. In the provided code, I didn't define any functions or classes but used only functions and classes defined in the module.

&nbsp;

```python
import example_module as ex
# import example_module
# from example_module import hello

print(ex.hello("Shine"))

cal=ex.calculate()
print(cal.add(2, 3))

print(ex.PI)
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| Hello Shine |
| None |
| 5 |
| 3.141592 |

# 2. Standard Modules
Python supports many standard modules. Here are some examples of standard modules.

&nbsp;

**sys**\
Allows access to the Python system.
- exit(): Finishes the program.
- argv: Accesses command line arguments.
- path: Accesses the system path.

&nbsp;

**math**\
Allows the use of mathematical functions.
- sin, cos, etc: Trigonometric functions.
- log: Logarithmic function.
- ceil, floor: Calculate the roundign up and down values.
- pi, e: Commonly used constants are defined.

&nbsp;

**time**\
Allows the use of functions related to time.
- time: Current time.
- sleedp: Stops the program for a set amount of time.
