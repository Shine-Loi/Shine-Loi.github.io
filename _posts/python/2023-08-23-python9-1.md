# 1. Exception Handling
The exception handling is a kind of preparation to avoid errors during the execution of the program. For example, if you try to divide a number by 0, Python will raise a 'ZeroDivisionError' error. You can use the 'try ~ except' statement to handle errors. The 'try ~ except' statement cosists of the followings.

&nbsp;

- try: The code that has a possibility to cause an error.
- except: The code that is executed when a specific error is caused.
- else: The code that is executed when no error is caused.
- finally: The code that is always executed regardless of whether errors are caused or not.

&nbsp;

Sometimes, you don't have to use the 'else' and 'finally' statement. The example code of the 'ZeroDivisionError' that I mentioned above is below.

&nbsp;

```python
try:
    result=10/0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Error {e}")
else:
    print("No error occurred.")
finally:
    print("Finish")
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| Error division by zero |
| Finish |

&nbsp;

# 2. User Defined Exception
Python defines some errors such as the 'ZeroDivisionError' I mentioned above, but sometimes, you need to define a new error. You can create a new child class that is inherited by the 'Exception' class, which is basically defined by Python. In the code below, I created the 'NewError' class to handle errors. The 'raise' keyword in the 'try' statement is used to cause an error.

&nbsp;

```python
class NewError(Exception):
    # Definition of a new exception class inheriting from the built-in Exception class
    def __init__(self, message="New error occurred."):
        self.message=message
        super().__init__(self.message)

try:
    # Attempt to raise a new exception
    raise NewError("This is a new exception.")
except NewError as ne:
    # Handling the new exception
    print(f"Caught an exception: {ne}")
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| Caught an exception: This is a new exception. |
