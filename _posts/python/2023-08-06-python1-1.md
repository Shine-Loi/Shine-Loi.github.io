# 1. Comment
We usually use comments to explain the code, and Python will ignore them. It will require a lot of time to understand a short code. Even if you write code yourself, it is very difficult to analyze your code after a few days.

&nbsp;

You can write single-line comments or multi-line comments.
- Single-line comments: They start with a hashtag (#).
- Multi-line comments: They are surrounded by triple quotation marks(""")

&nbsp;

```python
# Comments are used to explain code.

# This is a single-line comment.
# Single-line comments begin with hash character(#).

"""
This is a multi-line comment.
Multi-line comments begin with triple double quotation marks
and end with triple double quotation marks.

"""
```
