# 1. Functions
Functions are bundles of code designed to perform specific tasks. By encapsulating codes that are executed repeatedly into functions, you can simply call the functions instead of writing the same code multiple times. You can declare functions like the example below.

&nbsp;

```python
def function_name():
    write a code
```

&nbsp;

```python
def myfunc():
    print("2. The function prints this sentence.")

print("1. This is a first sentence.")
myfunc()
print("3. This is a last sentence.")
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| 1. This is a first sentence. |
| 2. The function prints this sentence. |
| 3. This is a last sentence. |

&nbsp;

# 2. Arguments and Parameters
When you declare functions, you can set parameters within parentheses (). Parameters are used in the function as local variables. The argument is a value that substitutes for the parameters when you call the function. It is important to provide the same number of arguments as parameters.

&nbsp;

```python
def namefunc(name):
    print("My name is {}".format(name))

namefunc("Shine")
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| My name is Shine. |

&nbsp;

```python
def plusfunc(a, b):
    print(a+b)

plusfunc(2, 3)
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| 5 |
