# 1. Recursive Functions
Recursive Function is a method that calls the function itself. You can use recursive function instead of loop statements to simplify your code.

&nbsp;

There are some precautions when using recursive functions.
- Define Base Case: You have to set an exit condition to prevent calling a function infinitely.
- Memory Usage: The more the recursion is repeated, the more memory is used. Python has a limit of 1000 recursive calls, and an error occurs if this limit is exceeded.

&nbsp;

The code below is a function that calculates factorial, a representative example of recursive functions.

&nbsp;

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n==0 or n==1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n*factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))
```

| 120 |

The code below is a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence, another representative example of recursive functions. You can see that I called a recursive function twice simultaneously to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.

&nbsp;

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n<=0:
        return "This value is not valid."
    elif n==1:
        return 0
    elif n==2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2)
    
print(fibonacci(10))
```
