# 1. pickle Module
It is more difficult to input or output data stored in data structures such as objects, lists, and so on, than normal strings. We need to use the 'pickle' module to input and output objects as a type of binary in the file.

&nbsp;

In the code below, I created an object through the 'person' class and stored and loaded the object. You can use the commands below to open 'pickle' files.

&nbsp;

```python
with open(filename, mode) as file
```

&nbsp;

The 'with' statement will close a file automatically when you finish using the file, so you don't have to use the close() function. Write the name of the file to store in the 'filename' part. The 'pickle' file is stored as a type of binary, you have to use the 'wb' or 'rb' mode instead of the 'w' or 'r' mode to write or read files. It consists of binary code, so you cannot read an origin file. You can use the dump() function to write files and use the load() function to read files.

&nbsp;

When you execute the code below, the 'example.pkl' file will be created in the same folder as the code. The pprint() function in the code below is often used for debugging or checking the data structure, and is useful when you handle large-sized data or data with overlapped structure. I referenced 'pprint' module to use pprint() function.

&nbsp;

```python
import pickle
from pprint import pprint

# Class representing a person with name and age
class person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name=name
        self.age=age
        
# Create a per object
per=person("Shine", 24)

# Save to a file
with open("example.pkl", "wb") as file:
    pickle.dump(per, file)

# Load from a file
with open("example.pkl", "rb") as file:
    loaded_per=pickle.load(file)

# Print the object
pprint(loaded_per)
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| <__main__.person object at 0x0000014C4116BCD0> |
| (Create the 'example.pkl' file in the same folder.) |
