# 1. Literal
In programming, a literal refers to a fixed value that doesn't changed. In other words, a literal is a way to represent values. I will explain this with some examples below.

&nbsp;

## 1-1. Numeric Literal
- Integer literal: Integers in Python can be represented in binary, octal, or hexadecimal when they start with 0b, 0o, or 0x, respectively. If a number doesn't contain these characters and is denoted as just a number, it is considered a decimal number.
- Real number literal: A number is considered a real number if it contains a decimal point or the letter 'e' which denotes the power of 10.
- Complex number literal: If a number ends with 'j', it represents the imaginary part of a complex number.

&nbsp;

```python
a=0b1111
b=0o17
c=15
d=0xf

print("a:", a)
print("b:", b)
print("c:", c)
print("d:", d)

e=3.14
f=5e-3

print("e:", e)
print("f:", f)

g=1+2j
print("g:", g)
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| a: 15 |
| b: 15 |
| c: 15 |
| d: 15 |
| e: 3.14 |
| f: 0.005 |
| g: (1+2j) |

&nbsp;

## 1-2. String and Character literal
If you want to store several sentences consisting of multiple lines, you can use triple quotation marks("""). It is the same method used to create multi-line comments. When you insert the letter 'u' in front of the string, Python will print it as Unicode. In the case of the letter 'r', Python will print the origin sentence regardless of escape characters or command keywords.

&nbsp;

```python
singleline_str="This is a normal string."
print("singleline_str:", singleline_str)

char_val="A"
print("char_val:", char_val)

multiline_str="""This is a multiline string.
You have to use tripple quotation marks."""
print("multiline_str:", multiline_str)

unicode_val=u"\u0053\u0068\u0069\u006e\u0065"
print("unicode_val:", unicode_val)

raw_str=r"This is a\n raw string."
print("raw_str:", raw_str)
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| singleline_str: This is a normal string. |
| char_val: A |
| multiline_str: This is a multiline string. |
| You have to use tripple quotation marks. |
| unicode_val: Shine |
| raw_str: This is a\n raw string. |
