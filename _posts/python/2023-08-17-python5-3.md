# 1. Tuple
A tuple is similar to a list. However, you cannot modify a tuple after declaring it. A tuple is considered constant, meaning its values cannot be changed. Therefore, you can use a tuple as a key in a dictionary.

&nbsp;

```python
flowertup=("Rose", "Tulip", "Lilac", "Daisy", "Lily", "Iris")
print(flowertup)
print(type(flowertup))
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| ('Rose', 'Tulip', 'Lilac', 'Daisy', 'Lily', 'Iris') |
| <class 'tuple'> |
