# 1. Identation
In general, in programming, we use identation for highly readable typography. However, identation is very important in Python, as it specifies code blocks. In other words, while other programming languages use braces {} to define code blocks and errors may not occur without indentation, in Python, not using identation will result in errors. Indentation should be consistent within the same code block. The code below is provided to illustrate an example of indentation, although it includes content that will be covered later.

&nbsp;

```python
def product():
    # Block 1
    for i in range(1,10):
        # Block 2: Belongs to Block 1
        for j in range(1,10):
            # Block 3: Belongs to Block 2
            result=i*j
            print("%d X %d = %d" %(i, j, result))
            # The end of a Block 3

# The following code is not belonging to blocks above.
product()
```
