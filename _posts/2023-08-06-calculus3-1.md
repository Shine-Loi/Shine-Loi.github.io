# 1) Absolute Maximum Values and Absolute Minimum Values
The statement that a function \\(f(x)\\) has a maximum value at \\(x=a\\) means that the function value at \\(x=a\\) is greater than the other function values. Similarly, when we say a function \\(f(x)\\) has a minimun value at \\(x=a\\) is smaller than the other function values.

&nbsp;

## Theorem 3.1: Absolute Maximum Values and Absolute Minimum Values
If a function \\(f\\) has an absolute maximum value at \\(x=a\\), it means that \\(f(x)\leq f(a)\\) for all \\(x\\) in its domain.

&nbsp;

If a function \\(f\\) has an absolute minimum value at \\(x=a\\), it means that \\(f(x)\geq f(a)\\) for all \\(x\\) in its domain.

# 2) Extreme Values
The absolute maximum values and the absolute minimum values are the greatest or smallest values in the function's entire domain, whereas the local maximum values and the local minimum values are the greatest or smallest values near specific point.

&nbsp;

## Theorem 3.2: Extreme Values
If a function \\(f\\) has a local maximum value at \\(x=a\\), it means that \\(f(x)\leq f(a)\\) near \\(a\\).

&nbsp;

If a function \\(f\\) has a local minimum value at \\(x=a\\), it means that \\(f(x)\geq f(a)\\) near \\(a\\).

&nbsp;

## Theorem 3.3: The First Derivative Theorem for Local Extreme Values
If a function \\(f\\) has local maximum value or local minimum value at \\(x=a\\), it satisfies \\(f'(a)=0\\).\
If \\(f'(a)>0\\), a function \\(f\\) increases at \\(x=a\\).\
If \\(f'(a)<0\\), a function \\(f\\) decreases at \\(x=a\\).
