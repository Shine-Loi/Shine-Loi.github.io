# 1) The Mean Value Theorem
## Theorem 3.4: Rolle's Theorem
Suppose that a function \\(y=f(x)\\) is continuous on the closed interval \\([a,b]\\) and differentiable in the open interval \\((a,b)\\). If \\(f(a)=f(b)\\), then there is at least one number \\(c\\) in \\((a,b)\\) where \\(f'(c)=0\\).

## Theorem 3.5: The Mean Value Theorem
Suppose that a function \\(y=f(x)\\) is continuous on the closed interval \\([a,b]\\) and differentiable in the open interval \\((a,b)\\). Then, there is at least one number \\(c\\) in \\((a,b)\\) where \\(\displaystyle \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}=f'(c)\\)

## Corollary 1
If a function \\(f(x)\\) satisfies \\(f'(x)=0\\) at all \\(x\\) in its domain, \\(f(x)\\) is a constant function.

## Corollary 2
If functions \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) satisfy \\(f'(x)=g'(x)\\) at all \\(x\\) in their domain, then they satisfy the equation \\(f(x)=g(x)+C\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant.
