# 1) Implicit Functions
Implicit functions can be defined as "equations containing functions". As seen in the definition, implicit functions are a concept used to represent non-function entities(such as equations) in a manner similar to functions. While functions are generally represented in the form \\(y=f(x)\\), implicit functions are usually denoted as \\(f(x,y)=0\\). The equation of a circle serves as a representative example of an implicit function. Implicit functions are described with an independent variable \\(x\\) and a dependent variable \\(y\\).

&nbsp;

For example, for easy understanding, we can transform a function \\(y=2\cdot x+1\\) into an implicit function by writing it as \\(y-2\cdot x-1=0\\).

# 2) Implicit Differentiation
When differentiating implicit functions, we assume that \\(y\\) is differentiable with respect to \\(x\\). With this assumption, we can differentiate an implicit function using the following two steps outlined in Theorem 2.8 below.

&nbsp;

## Theorem 2.9: Implicit Differentiation
1. Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to \\(x\\).
2. Solve the resulting equation for \\(\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}\\)

&nbsp;

## EXAMPLE
If we differentiate the circle equation \\(x^2+y^2=1\\) following the above steps, it is as follows.

&nbsp;

1. Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to \\(x\\).
\\(\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx} x^2+\frac{dy}{dx} y^2=\frac{dy}{dx} 1\\)\
\\(\displaystyle 2\cdot x+2\cdot y\cdot \frac{dy}{dx} =0\\)

&nbsp;

2. Solve the resulting equation for \\(\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}\\)\
\\(\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{x}{y}\\)
