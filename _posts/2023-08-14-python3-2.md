# 1. String Concatenation
String in Python represents a type that consists of several characters. Python considers only one character as a string whose length is 1, unlike some other programming languages. I already explained the way to print a string in the "1-2. Print Data" post, so I will skip it in this post.\

We can perform addition and multiplication operations on strings. String addition concatenates several strings, and multiplication repeats the same string several times.

&nbsp;

```python
print("Hello"+"World")
print("Hello"*5)
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| HelloWorld |
| HelloHelloHelloHelloHello |

&nbsp;

# 2. String Slicing
You can easily slice a string using indices. The method for slicing a string is explained below. It is important to note that in Python, if you set the last number of a range as n, it will operate until n-1.

&nbsp;

- a[6]: 6th character (The first character is 0th.)
- a[6:]: From the 6th character to the last character
- a[:7]: From the first character to the 6th character (Until just before the 7th character)
- a[3:7]: From the 3rd character to the 6th character (Until just before the 7th character)
- a[-5]: 5th character from the end
- a[3:-5]: From the 3rd character to 6th character from the end (Until just before the 5th character from the end.)

&nbsp;

```python
a="Hello World!"

print("a[6]:", a[6])
print("a[6:]:", a[6:])
print("a[:7]:", a[:7])
print("a[3:7]:", a[3:7])
print("a[-5]:", a[-5])
print("a[3:-5]:", a[3:-5])
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| a[6]: W |
| a[6:]: World! |
| a[:7]: Hello W |
| a[3:7]: lo W |
| a[-5]: o |
| a[3:-5]: lo W |
