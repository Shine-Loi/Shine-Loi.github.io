# 1. Input Data
You can use the input() function to input data. While you can use the input data immediately, generally, we store the data in a variable. When you write 'a=input()', it means storing data into a variable 'a'. If you enclose a string within parentheses (), Python will print it before you input data.

&nbsp;

```python

```

&nbsp;

| Input Example |
|---|
| Shine |

| Output |
|---|
| What is your name?: Shine |
| Hello Shine |

&nbsp;

# 2. Check Data Type
In Python, you don't have set types of variables before you declare them. With this characteristic, you can store various types of data in a variable. You can use type() function to check the type of a variable. When you enclose a variable within parentheses () of type() function, Python will print a type of a variable.

&nbsp;

```python
a="Hello World"
b=24
c=3.14

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| <class 'str'> |
| <class 'int'> |
| <class 'float'> |
