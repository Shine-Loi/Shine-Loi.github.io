# 1) The Chain Rule
The chain rule is commonly known as the method to differentiating composite functions. For instance, consider a function \\(f(u)\\) for \\(u\\) and a function \\(g(x)\\) for \\(x\\). If we let \\(u=g(x)\\), we can represent it as \\(f(g(x))\\). Assuming \\(y=f(g(x))\\), the rate of change in \\(y\\) with respect to the change in \\(x\\) can be denoted as \\(\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}\\). Here, \\(y\\) is a function of \\(u\\), and \\(u\\) is a function of \\(x\\). The change in \\(x\\) will result in a change in \\(u\\), and subsequently, it will cause a change in \\(y\\). The chain rule provides a mathematical framework for this process. In calculus, we often use it without proof.

## Theorem 2.8: The Chain Rule
Assume that \\(g\\) is differentiable for \\(x\\), and \\(f\\) is differentiable for \\(g\\). Then the composite function of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) is differentiable for \\(x\\), and can be denoted as follows:\
\\(F(x)=f(g(x))\\)\
\\(F'(x)=f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x)\\)

If we define \\(y=f(u)\\) and \\(u=g(x)\\), we can change the expression above to follows:\
\\(\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}\\)
