# 1. Operators Precedence
The precedence of each operator is already decided. This means that operations will be performed according to the precedence, regardless of the order in which they are written. If you don't consider this precedence, the result may differ from your expectations. Using parentheses to group operations with the highest priority is a good method when you are unsure about the precedence.

| Priority | Operator | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | () | Parentheses |
