# 1) The Proof of a Limit
In the Chapter 1-1, we used intuitive methods such as checking the graph or calculating function values, which rely on the fact that the limit and the function value are the same (in the case of a continuous function). In this chapter, we will use a precise method to prove limits.

&nbsp;

## Theorem 1.4: Epsilon-Delta Argument
Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) is defined in an open interval including \\(a\\). Suppose also that, as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\), \\(f(x)\\) has a limit \\(P\\). We can precisely prove this using the Epsilon-Delta Argument.

&nbsp;

For every positive number \\(\epsilon\\), if there exists a positive number \\(\delta\\) such that whenever \\(0<|x-a|<\delta\\), then \\(|f(x)-P|<\epsilon\\).
