# 1. for Loops
Generally, 'for' loops in some other programming languages are based on the number of repeats. However, in Python, 'for' loops can iterate not only based on the number of repeats but also around elements of objects.\
("end-" "" in the code below means it will not print a line break but print a space at the end of a string.)

&nbsp;

```python
flowerlist=["Rose", "Tulip", "Lilac", "Daisy", "Lily", "Iris"]
for flower in flowerlist:
    print(flower, end=" ")
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| Rose Tulip Lilac Daisy Lily Iris  |

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 2. range() Function
The range() function is used to create a sequence of numbers within a specific range. This function is often used with 'for' loops. You can create a range from 0 to a specific number by specifying the number within the parentheses () of the range() function, as shown below.

&nbsp;

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i, end=" ")
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| 0 1 2 3 4  |

&nbsp;

You can set the first number, last number, and the step (increasing or decreasing value) with the range() function. If you want to create a sequence that increases by a step of c from a to b-1, you can write it as shown follow: "range(a, b, c)". If c is a negative number and a is greater than b, it will create a decreasing sequence.

&nbsp;

```python
for i in range(3, 20, 2):
    print(i, end=" ")

print()

for i in range(10, 3, -1):
    print(i, end=" ")
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19  |
| 10 9 8 7 6 5 4  |

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 3. enumerate() Function
You can declare indices automatically when Python iterates over elements of objects by using the enumerate() function.

&nbsp;

```python
for i, flower in enumerate(flowerlist):
    print(i, flower)
```

&nbsp;

| Output |
|---|
| 0 Rose |
| 1 Tulip |
| 2 Lilac |
| 3 Daisy |
| 4 Lily |
| 5 Iris |
