# 1) Rate of Change
Rate of change refers to the degree of change. The rage of change in a function is often denoted using \\(\Delta\\). A common example of utilizing the rate of change is in the concept of 'speed'. Speed is calculated by dividing the rate of change in distance traveled by the rate of change in time taken to cover that distance. The resulting speed is refer to as average speed. Simiarly, the rate of change between two points in a function is defined as the average rate of change. The average rate of change in a function indicates the rate at which the average function value changes concerning the change in \\(x\\).

&nbsp;

## Theorem 2.1: Average Rate of Chagne
As \\(x\\) changes from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) in the function \\(f(x)\\), the average rate of change of \\(f(x)\\) in the interval \\([a,b]\\) is defined as \\(\displaystyle \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} =\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\\). Generally, the average rate of change is described as the slope of a straight line connecting two points \\((a,f(a))\\), \\((b,f(b)\\).

# 2) Instantaneous Rate of Change
If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from Theorem 2.1 converge to a single point, in other words, the two points are close enough to consider the difference between them as almost \\(0\\), the average rate of change can be regarded as the rate of change at that moment. This is referred to as the instantaneous rate of change, which is commonly known as the 'Derivative' in calculus. However, it is important to note that you can't always calculate the derivative for every function. The instantaneous rate of change is defined using a limit, so if a function doesn't have a limit value, you can't calculate the derivative.

&nbsp;

## Theorem 2.2: Instantaneous Rate of Change
The function \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x=a\\), and if the value of \\(\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}\\) exists, \\(f(x)\\) is 'differentiable' at \\(x=a\\). This value is defined as the instantaneous rate of change of \\(f(x)\\) at \\(x=a\\).

# 3) Derivative
The derivative is a function that represents the slope of the tangent line to a function. In simple terms, this means that the derivative, calculated for a specific point \\(x=a\\) in Theorem 2.2, is generalized and expressed in the form of a function. The derivative of \\(y=f(x)\\) is generally denoted as follows:\
\\(f'(x)\\), \\(y'\\), \\(\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}\\), \\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} f(x)\\)

&nbsp;

We use the term 'Differentiate' when obtaining a derivative, and a function is said to be 'Differentiable' when it has a derivative.

&nbsp;

## Theorem 2.3: Derivative
If a function \\(f(x)\\) has the value \\(\displaystyle \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} for \\(x\\) within its domain, the function is called the derivative of \\(f(x)\\) and expressed as \\(f'(x)\\)
