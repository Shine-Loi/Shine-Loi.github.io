# 1) Rate of Change
Rate of change refers to the degree of change. The rage of change in a function is often denoted using \\(\Delta\\). A common example of utilizing the rate of change is in the concept of 'speed'. Speed is calculated by dividing the rate of change in distance traveled by the rate of change in time taken to cover that distance. The resulting speed is refer to as average speed. Simiarly, the rate of change between two points in a function is defined as the average rate of change. The average rate of change in a function indicates the rate at which the average function value changes concerning the change in \\(x\\).
