# 1) Limits of Function Values
Sometimes, we need to calculate the value of a function \\(y=f(x)\\) at a point very close to a specific point \\(a\\). For example, let's consider the function \\(y={x^2 -a^2 \over x-a}\\).

&nbsp;

In cases like this, \\(x\\) cannot have the value of \\(0\\) because no fraction cannot have \\(0\\) as a denominator. However, \\(f(x)\\) is defined at all points except for \\(x=a\\). Therfore, we can calculate the limit of the function \\(f(x)\\) at the point \\(a\\). For any \\(x\neq a\\), the function \\(f(x)\\) can be simplified as follows.\
\\(f(x)={x^2 -a^2 \over x-a}={(x+a)(x-a) \over x-a}=x+a, \ x\neq a\\)

&nbsp;

In the given case, \\(f(x)\\) has the value of \\(2a\\) as \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\). This represents a fundamental concept of function limits. If \\(f(x)\\) is close to the number \\(P\\) as \\(x\\) is close to \\(a\\), then we say that "\\(f\\) approaches the limit \\(P\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\)", and write \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x)=P\\). It is crucial to understand that \\(x\\) constantly approaches \\(a\\) but never actually reaches it.

&nbsp;

Following three functions will help you understand it.

&nbsp;

(a) \\(f(x)={x^2 -1 \over x-1}\\)\
The function \\(f(x)\\) is not defined at \\(x=1\\). However, we can calculate the limit value at that point. This occurs because \\(x\\) continually approaches \\(1\\) but never be \\(1\\) as I mentioned. You can intuitively see that the graph of \\(f(x)\\) approaches \\(2\\) near \\(x=1\\) with Figure 1.1. This result is same as the value calculated from the following expression.\
\\(\lim_{x\rightarrow 1} {x^2 -1 \over x-1}=\lim_{x\rightarrow 1} {(x+1)(x-1) \over x-1}=\lim_{x\rightarrow 1} x+1=2\\)

&nbsp;

(b) \\(g(x)=x+1\\)\
Among these functions, the function \\(g(x)\\) is the easiest example. It is defined at the range of all real numbers, unlike the function \\(f(x)\\) which is not defined at \\(x=1\\). We can easily verify that both the value of function and it's limit value for \\(g(x)\\) are the same, which is 2.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
​
(c) \\(h(x)=\begin{cases} {x^2 -1 \over x-1} & (x\neq 1) \cr 2 & (x=1) \end{cases}\\)\
The function \\(h(x)\\) is very similar to the function \\(f(x)\\), but the difference lie in the fact that \\h(x)\\) is defined at \\(x=1\\). The limit of \\(h(x)\\) can be calculated using the same method as with \\(f(x)\\). We can find that the limit and function value of \\(h(x)\\) are the same. This property is called continuous at \\(x=1\\). I will post about continuity later.

# 2) Limit Laws
Limit Laws are simplified expressions of fundamental properties of function limits. In calculus, we will use them without proof.

&nbsp;

## Theorem 1.1: Limit Laws
If \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(a\\), and \\(k\\) are real numbers and \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x)=P\\) and \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} g(x)=Q\\), then\

(1) \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} [f(x) \pm g(x)] = P+Q\\)\
(2) \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} [k\times f(x)] = k\dot P\\)\
(3) \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} [f(x) \times g(x)] = P\dot Q\\)\
(4) \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} {f(x) \over g(x)} = {P \over Q}\\), \\(Q\neq 0\\)\
(5) \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} [f(x)]^n =P^n\\), \\(n\\) is a positive integer.\
(6) \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} \sqrt[n]{f(x)} =\sqrt[n]{P}\\), \\(n\\) is a positive integer.

&nbsp;

## Theorem 1.2: The Sandwich Theorem
Suppose that \\(f(x)\leq g(x)\leq h(x)\\) when \\(x\\) is near \\(a\\).\
Suppose also that \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x)=\lim_{x\rightarrow a} h(x)=P\\).\
Then \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} g(x)=P\\).

# 3) One-Sided Limits
Suppose that the limit of \\(f\\) at \\(x=

x=a에서 함수 f의 극한값이 L이라면, x가 a보다 작은 쪽에서 접근할 때와 a보다 큰 쪽에서 접근할 때 모두 f의 함숫값을 L에 가까워지도록 할 것이다. 즉 x=a 지점을 기준으로 양쪽의 극한값이 같다는 의미이다. 이와 같이 극한값은 한쪽 극한만 선택하여 계산할 수 있다. x=a보다 작은 쪽(왼쪽)에서의 극한값을 좌극한, x=a보다 큰 쪽(오른쪽)에서의 극한값을 우극한이라고 부른다. 그리고 x=a에서 좌극한과 우극한 값이 같을 때, 함수 f가 x=a에서 극한값을 가진다고 말할 수 있다.
