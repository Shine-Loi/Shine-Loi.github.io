# 1) Limits of Function Values
Sometimes, we need to calculate the value of a function \\(y=f(x)\\) at a point very close to a specific point \\(a\\). For example, let's consider the function \\(y={x^2 -a^2 \over x-a}\\).

&nbsp;

In cases like this, \\(x\\) cannot have the value of \\(0\\) because no fraction cannot have \\(0\\) as a denominator. However, \\(f(x)\\) is defined at all points except for \\(x=a\\). Therfore, we can calculate the limit of the function \\(f(x)\\) at the point \\(a\\). For any \\(x\neq a\\), the function \\(f(x)\\) can be simplified as follows.\
\\(f(x)={x^2 -a^2 \over x-a}={(x+a)(x-a) \over x-a}=x+a, \ x\neq a\\)

&nbsp;

In the given case, \\(f(x)\\) has the value of \\(2a\\) as \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\). This represents a fundamental concept of function limits. If \\(f(x)\\) is close to the number \\(P\\) as \\(x\\) is close to \\(a\\), then we say that "\\(f\\) approaches the limit \\(P\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\)", and write \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x)=P\\). It is crucial to understand that \\(x\\) constantly approaches \\(a\\) but never actually reaches it.

&nbsp;

Following three functions will help you understand it.

&nbsp;

(a) \\(f(x)={x^2 -1 \over x-1}\\)\
The function \\(f(x)\\) is not defined at \\(x=1\\). However, we can calculate the limit value at that point. This occurs because \\(x\\) continually approaches \\(1\\) but never be \\(1\\) as I mentioned. You can intuitively see that the graph of \\(f(x)\\) approaches \\(2\\) near \\(x=1\\) with Figure 1.1. This result is same as the value calculated from the following expression.\
\\(\lim_{x\rightarrow 1} {x^2 -1 \over x-1}=\lim_{x\rightarrow 1} {(x+1)(x-1) \over x-1}=\lim_{x\rightarrow 1} x+1=2\\)

&nbsp;

(b) \\(g(x)=x+1\\)\
Among these functions, the function \\(g(x)\\) is the easiest example. It is defined at the range of all real numbers, unlike the function \\(f(x)\\) which is not defined at \\(x=1\\). We can easily verify that both the value of function and it's limit value for \\(g(x)\\) are the same, which is 2.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
â€‹
(c) \\(h(x)=\begin{cases} {x^2 -1 \over x-1} & (x\neq 1) \cr 2 & (x=1) \end{cases}\\)\
The function \\(h(x)\\) is very similar to the function \\(f(x)\\), but the difference lie in the fact that \\h(x)\\) is defined at \\(x=1\\). The limit of \\(h(x)\\) can be calculated using the same method as with \\(f(x)\\). We can find that the limit and function value of \\(h(x)\\) are the same. This property is called continuous at \\(x=1\\). I will post about continuity later.

# 2) Limit Laws
Limit Laws are simplified expressions of fundamental properties of function limits. In calculus, we will use them without proof.

&nbsp;

## Theorem 1.1: Limit Laws
If \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(a\\), and \\(k\\) are real numbers and \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x)=P\\) and \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} g(x)=Q\\), then\

(1) \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} [f(x) \pm g(x)] = P+Q\\)\
(2) \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} [k\times f(x)] = k\dot P\\)\
(3) \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} [f(x) \times g(x)] = P\dot Q\\)\
(4) \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} {f(x) \over g(x)} = {P \over Q}\\), \\(Q\neq 0\\)\
(5) \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} [f(x)]^n =P^n\\), \\(n\\) is a positive integer.\
(6) \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} \sqrt[n]{f(x)} =\sqrt[n]{P}\\), \\(n\\) is a positive integer.

&nbsp;

## Theorem 1.2: The Sandwich Theorem
Suppose that \\(f(x)\leq g(x)\leq h(x)\\) when \\(x\\) is near \\(a\\).\
Suppose also that \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x)=\lim_{x\rightarrow a} h(x)=P\\).\
Then \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow a} g(x)=P\\).

# 3) One-Sided Limits
Suppose that the limit of \\(f\\) at \\(x=a\\) is \\(P\\). Then, in both cases where \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) from the left and where \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) from the right, the function value approaches \\(P\\). In other words, the limits from both sides of \\(x=a\\) are the same. In cases like this, we can calculate only one side's limit. If \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) from the left, we call it the **left-hand limit** or **limit from the left**. From the right, it is called the **right-hand limit** or **limit from the right**. \\(f\\) has a limit when the left-hand limit and right-hand limit are the same

&nbsp;

## EX)
The right-hand limit of \\(f(x)={x \over |x|}\\) is \\(1\\) where \\(x\\) approaches \\(0\\) from the right. We write it as \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow 0^+} f(x)=1\\).
However, the limit is \\(-1\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(0\\) from the left. We write it as \\(\lim_{x\rightarrow 0^-} f(x)=-1\\).
Since the limits from both sides are not the same, \\(f(x)\\) does not have a limit.

&nbsp;

## Theorem 1.3: The Definition of a Limit
\\(f(x)\\) has a limit as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) if and only if the right-hand limit and left-hand limit are the same.

&nbsp;

# 4) Special Cases of Limits
Limits of functions are not always defined as a specific value. We can understand the special cases of limits with the following examples.

&nbsp;

## EX 1) The Function does not have a Limit
