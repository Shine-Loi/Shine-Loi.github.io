# 1. Sympy Module
The sympy module provides funcions for algebraic operations, solving equations, matrix operations, and more. In the example code below, I used the sympy module to set 'x' as an unknown and to solve equations.

# 2. Example codes
## 2-1. Solution of Equations
**(Ex 1) Solve the equation \(3x+7=-2\).**

&nbsp;

At first, I defined the unknown 'x' with the function 'symbols()'. The unknowns generated by the 'symbols()' function can be used in operations performed in the sympy module. And then, substitute the expression into the variable 'exp'. Make sure to write the expression in the form '\((expression)=0\)' by moving all terms to one side. You don't need to simplify the expression; Python will do it automatically. Finally, the equation will be solved automatically by the 'solve()' function. In the case of multiple solutions, the 'solve()' function stores the solutions as a list. In (Ex 1), There is only one solution, so just print the first solution with the 'solutoin[0]' command.
