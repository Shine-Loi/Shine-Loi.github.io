# 1) Linear Approximation
In science or engineering, we often streamline complex calculations by approximating values rather than computing precise ones. This is almost necessary due to the intricacies involved. The linear approximation is a fundamental method for such approximations. If we draw a tangent line for \\(f(x)\\) at \\(x=a\\), the values of \\(f(x)\\) and the tangent line are very close when \\(x\\) is near \\(a\\). The linear approximation is a method to calculate the function values of the tangent line instead of the complicated function's precise values. The equation of a tangent line has a slope of \\(f'(a)\\) and passes through the point \\((a,f(a))\\).

## Theorem 2.10: Linear Approximation
\\(f(x)\approx f(a)+f'(a)\cdot (x-a)\\)
