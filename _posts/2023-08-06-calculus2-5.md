# 1) Linear Approximation
In science or engineering, we usually omit the cumbersome processes by calculating the approximate values of complicated functions rather than calculating the precise values. It is almost nessecery. The linear approximation is the basic method of approximations. If we draw a tangent line for \\(f(x)\\) at \\(x=a\\), the value of \\(f(x)\\) and the value of a tangent line are very similar while \\(x\\) is close to \\(a\\).
